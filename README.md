<body>This is my first blog attempt. Decentralization will eventually shape the way the world views <i><b>true</b></i> freedom of speech and expression. Currently, our antiquated financial, political, and trading system throughout the world is nearing a pivotal head. Glancing at any news source will surely give chills down any empathetic humanâ€™s spine: multiple wars, inflation, privacy breeches, data selling, hunger, poverty, ethical rights, and much more. With the advent of technology, our future gains greater and greater momentum into the future. But what about our past, do we have nothing to learn?

I want to explore the depths of the human psyche, moralaity of laws and religion, tech and the future of A.I., with a sprinkle of devil's advocate througout.
